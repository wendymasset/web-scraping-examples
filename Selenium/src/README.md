# Selenium Web Scraping Example

This directory contains an example of web scraping using the Selenium library. Selenium is a powerful tool for automating web browsers and is particularly useful for scraping dynamic content that is generated by JavaScript.

## Prerequisites

Before running the scraper, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Selenium library
- A web driver (e.g., ChromeDriver for Google Chrome)

You can install the Selenium library using pip:

```
pip install selenium
```

## Setting Up the Web Driver

1. Download the appropriate web driver for your browser:
   - [ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/)
   - [GeckoDriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases) for Firefox

2. Place the web driver executable in a directory that is included in your system's PATH, or specify the path directly in the `scraper.py` file.

## Running the Scraper

To run the scraper, execute the following command in your terminal:

```
python scraper.py
```

## What the Scraper Does

The scraper automates the browser to navigate to a specified URL, waits for the dynamic content to load, and then extracts the desired data from the page. The extracted data is then processed and can be saved or displayed as needed.

## Example Usage

You can modify the `scraper.py` file to change the target URL and the data extraction logic based on your requirements. Make sure to handle any potential exceptions and ensure that the web scraping complies with the website's terms of service.
